## Distributed Systems

### Definition
Distributed system is collection of independent software components that work together to accomplish a bigger task.

### Why Use distributed systems?
Modern applications need to serve millions of customers and manage vast amount of data. As software system grow, they face challenges like scaling, maintenance, and avoiding single point of failure. By breaking a system into smaller, independent components that co-ordinate with each other, distributed systems address these issues.

### Advantages
 - Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently.
 - Independent development: Teams can develop and manage them independently.
 - Flexibility of Tech stack: Different services can use different tech based on their specific requirements.
 - Fault tolerance: If 1 service fails, only that part of the app is affected, not the entire app.

### Challenges
Building distributed systems is complex. They require expertise to handle issues like maintaining consistency, managing concurrency and minimizing latency.
