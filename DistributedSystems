## Distributed Systems

### Definition
Distributed system is a system in which multiple software components work together in co-ordinated manner to acheive a bigger task.

Generally individual components are called Services and the architecture pattern used is Microservice architecture. Each component has a 1 or more (generally 1) responsibility.

### Why distributed systems?
In modern days, most softwares need to handle millions of customers with tons of data which makes the Software system bigger and bigger. As software system grows bigger, it introduces
serveral problems like scaling, maintainability, single point of failures etc. To address this, the system is divided into several smaller components which are developed and are run independently but co-ordinate 
to acheive the tasks.

### Advantages of Distributed Systems
 - Each component/service can be scaled independently.
 - They can developed and managed by teams independently.
 - Tech stack can be choose based on the functional and non-function requirements of the component. All components need not stick with the same tech stack.
 - If a single service fails, only that functionality would be impacted. The application still keeps running. In case of Monolith, the entire Application may be down.

### Challenges building distributed system solutions
While it has several advantages over Monolith software, it introduces several challenges.
 - Building distributed systems is complex and need expertise in that area.
 - It introduces challenges like maintaining consistency, concurrency, latency issues and hence they have to be build carefully to address these issues based on the requirements.
